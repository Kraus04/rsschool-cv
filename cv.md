###### The best CV ever

# Vladislav Pavlenko

I don’t know what to say really.

All comes down today. Either we heal as a team, or we’re going to crumble, inch by inch, til we’re finished. The inches we need are everywhere around us.

Here we fight for that inch. And either we heal now as a team or we will die as individuals. 

That’s IT, guys. That’s all it is.

Once upon a time I tried to fight for that inch with C#. But now I'm going to use JS.
*****
Usually I used this:
`Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");`
*****
That's why I never worked in IT.
